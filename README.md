This repository provides the per-instance logs produced on the public test set by four algorithmic configurations evaluated in our paper:
- LNS
- HyperLNS-lp
- HyperLNS-GDPP
- HyperLNS

Each configuration is run with either Gurobi or SCIP as the subroutine MILP solver. The folders below contain the raw logs exactly as generated by our runners.

Short directory map (solver + method) is as follows:
| Directory        | Solver  | Method        |
|------------------|---------|---------------|
| `grwlns_g`       | Gurobi  | HyperLNS-GDPP |
| `grwlns_gwl`     | Gurobi  | HyperLNS-lp   |
| `grwlns_ghybrid` | Gurobi  | HyperLNS      |
| `lnswg_g`        | Gurobi  | LNS           |
| `grwlns_s`       | SCIP    | HyperLNS-GDPP |
| `grwlns_swl`     | SCIP    | HyperLNS-lp   |
| `grwlns_shybrid` | SCIP    | HyperLNS      |
| `lnswg_s`        | SCIP    | LNS           |
